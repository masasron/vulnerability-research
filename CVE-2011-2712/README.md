## CVE-2012-3373

### Introduction
Apache Wicket, commonly referred to as Wicket, is a component-based web application framework for the Java programming language.
CVE-2012-3373 refrer to a cross-site scripting vulnerability affecting version period to 1.4.21.

### The Vulnerability
The vulnerability was in the `RequestCycle.java` file, spesificlly in the `encodeUrlFor` method.

```java
private final CharSequence encodeUrlFor(final IRequestTarget requestTarget)
{
    CharSequence url = getProcessor().getRequestCodingStrategy().encode(this, requestTarget);
    urlForNewWindowEncoding = false;
    return url;
}
```
This method is vulnerable to null byte injection, my assumption is that it will only encode the url up to the null byte, allowing attacker to use dengores charecters like `'"<>`.

This method is called by the public `urlFor` method used by `AjaxFormChoiceComponentUpdatingBehavior.java:151`

```java
/**
	 * @return event handler
	 */
	protected final CharSequence getEventHandler()
	{
		return generateCallbackScript(new AppendingStringBuffer("wicketAjaxPost('").append(
			getCallbackUrl()).append(
			"', wicketSerializeForm(document.getElementById('" + getComponent().getMarkupId() +
				"',false))"));
	}
```

As you can see above, the method builds a JavaScript code that will later be injected to the page.
The method `getCallbackUrl` is used for getting the current request url, that is later passed on to the `urlFor` method i've mention above.

### The Fix

The method was fixed by checking if the url containes a null byte, in case it does, it will remove it and everyting after it. (see A)

```java
private final CharSequence encodeUrlFor(final IRequestTarget requestTarget)
{
    CharSequence url = getProcessor().getRequestCodingStrategy().encode(this, requestTarget);
    url = JavascriptUtils.escapeQuotes(url);
    url = cutNilChar(url);
    urlForNewWindowEncoding = false;
    return url;
}
```
